<summary><strong>1. Understanding Collaboration – The Open-Source Mindset</strong></summary>

Git’s true power begins when your work meets others’.  
In teams or open-source projects, you rarely push directly to someone else’s repository — you **propose** your changes instead.

The collaboration cycle is simple:
```

Fork → Clone → Edit → Push → Pull Request → Review → Merge

````

Every Git hosting platform (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) builds around this pattern — protecting the main codebase while inviting improvement.

<summary><strong>2. Forking a Repository – Your Personal Copy on GitHub</strong></summary>

A **fork** is a complete copy of another repository under your account.  
It’s the first step toward contributing without touching the original.

Forking is **not a Git command** — it’s a GitHub feature.

### Why Fork?
- To propose fixes or features to public projects  
- To experiment without risk  
- To create your own version of an existing project  

### Steps on GitHub
1. Navigate to the repository you want to contribute to.  
2. Click the **Fork** button (top-right).  
3. GitHub creates a copy of that repo in your account.  

You now own a remote copy (e.g., `github.com/akhiltejadoosari/project`) where you have full write access.

<summary><strong>3. Cloning a Fork – Bringing It to Your Local Machine</strong></summary>

Once you have a fork on GitHub, you’ll want a **local copy** to work on.

### Clone the Fork
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhiltejadoosari/project.git
````

This downloads the full project history and places it in a new folder:

```
project/
├── .git/
├── src/
└── README.md
```

If you want a specific directory name:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhiltejadoosari/project.git myfolder
```

### Verify Your Local Copy

```bash
cd myfolder
git status
```

Output:

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

You now have a working environment linked to your **fork** (not the original repo yet).

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Setting Up Remotes – Communicating with Two Worlds</strong></summary>

After cloning, your local Git has one remote named **origin** — your fork on GitHub.
But we also want to keep contact with the **original repository**, often called **upstream**.

### Check Current Remotes

```bash
git remote -v
```

Example:

```
origin  https://github.com/akhiltejadoosari/project.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/akhiltejadoosari/project.git (push)
```

### Add the Original Repository

First, rename your current remote for clarity:

```bash
git remote rename origin upstream
```

Then re-add your own fork as **origin**:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/akhiltejadoosari/project.git
```

Now verify:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Output:

```
origin    https://github.com/akhiltejadoosari/project.git (push/pull)
upstream  https://github.com/original-owner/project.git (read-only)
```

**Terminology Summary**

| Remote     | Purpose                   | Access       |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| `origin`   | Your fork (personal copy) | Read + Write |
| `upstream` | Original repository       | Read-only    |

This dual-remote setup keeps you synchronized with both worlds.

<summary><strong>5. Pushing Changes – Syncing Local Work to GitHub</strong></summary>

Now you can modify files locally, commit, and push to your fork.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main
```

Output:

```
Enumerating objects: 8, done.
Writing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
To https://github.com/akhiltejadoosari/project.git
   facaeae..ebb1a5c  main -> main
```

Check your GitHub repository — your commit appears instantly.
This is your **private staging area** before proposing to the main project.

<details>
<summary><strong>6. Creating Pull Requests – Suggesting Changes Upstream</strong></summary>

Once your fork has new commits, it’s time to **suggest those changes** to the original project.

On GitHub:

1. Visit your fork’s page.
2. Click **Compare & Pull Request.**
3. Add a clear title and description explaining *why* the change matters.
4. Submit the Pull Request (PR).

The maintainers of the original repository will:

* Review your code, leave comments, or request adjustments.
* Merge it into their main branch when approved.

### Behind the Scenes

A pull request is a polite way of saying:

> “Here’s an improvement I made — would you like to include it?”

It doesn’t alter the upstream repo automatically; it simply opens a **merge proposal**.

---

**Maintainer View:**

* They see the PR listed under “Pull Requests.”
* They can **comment, approve, or close** it.
* When merged, your commit becomes part of their history.

<summary><strong>7. Collaboration Flow Recap</strong></summary>

Here’s the full journey in one glance:

```
          ┌─────────────────────────────┐
          │  Original Repo (Upstream)   │
          └────────────┬────────────────┘
                       │  (Fork)
                       ▼
          ┌─────────────────────────────┐
          │     Your GitHub Fork        │  ← remote: origin
          └────────────┬────────────────┘
                       │  (Clone)
                       ▼
          ┌─────────────────────────────┐
          │    Local Repository (Git)   │
          └────────────┬────────────────┘
                       │  (Push)
                       ▼
          ┌─────────────────────────────┐
          │    Your GitHub Repository   │
          └────────────┬────────────────┘
                       │  (Pull Request)
                       ▼
          ┌─────────────────────────────┐
          │  Original Repo (Merged)     │
          └─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Essential Flow:**

```
Fork → Clone → Remote Setup → Commit → Push → Pull Request → Review → Merge
```

<summary><strong>8. Mentor Insight</strong></summary>

This is where Git becomes **social engineering** — not just version control.
You now understand how to:

* Copy projects responsibly (`fork`)
* Work locally and push confidently (`clone` → `commit` → `push`)
* Collaborate respectfully through review (`pull request`)

These habits are what turn isolated coders into **collaborative engineers.**
Next, we’ll complete your mastery circle by learning **how to undo, recover, and rewrite history** safely in
**File 05 – Git Undo & Recovery – Mastering Revert, Reflog & Amend.**
