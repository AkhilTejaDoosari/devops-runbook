# Elastic Block Store (EBS)

Our network is now set — roads, gates, and rules are ready.
But a server can’t run without storage to hold its data.
That’s where EBS (Elastic Block Store) comes in.
Think of it as attaching an SSD to your EC2 instance — local, fast, and always there when you restart the machine.

<summary><strong>1. What Is EBS?</strong></summary>

**Elastic Block Store (EBS)** is a **persistent block storage** service designed for Amazon EC2 instances.  
Each EBS volume behaves like a **virtual hard drive** — you can format it, mount it, detach it, and re-attach it to other EC2 instances within the same Availability Zone (AZ).

Even if you stop or restart your instance, **the data remains intact**, making EBS a reliable storage layer for OS files, applications, and databases.

💡 **Analogy (minimal use):**  
Think of EBS as a **detachable SSD** for your EC2 instance — you can unplug it, carry it to another machine in the same data center (AZ), and plug it back in without losing your data.

**Key properties:**
- **Persistent**: Data survives instance stop/start.
- **Block-level**: You manage it like a raw disk.
- **Flexible**: You can increase size, change performance, or migrate without downtime.
- **AZ-scoped**: Must be in the same Availability Zone as the instance.

<summary><strong>2. How EBS Works with EC2</strong></summary>

EBS volumes attach to EC2 instances over the **availability zone network**.  
When you launch an EC2 instance, it can have:
- **Root Volume:** Stores OS and boot files.
- **Additional Data Volumes:** For app data, logs, or databases.

**High-level flow:**

```

EBS Volume  <──attached──>  EC2 Instance
│
└── Snapshots stored in S3 (for backup & cloning)

```

- EBS is **replicated automatically within its AZ** to prevent data loss.
- You can attach **multiple EBS volumes** to one EC2, or attach a single EBS volume to multiple EC2s (only for io1/io2 Multi-Attach use cases).

💡 **Use Case Examples:**
- Root volume for Linux/Windows OS.
- Application data storage for web servers.
- Database storage (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Persistent log storage or caching layer.

<summary><strong>2.1  Special Case – EBS Multi-Attach (io1 / io2 Volumes)</strong></summary>

Normally, a single EBS volume can be **attached to only one EC2 instance at a time**.  
That keeps data consistent, just like plugging a physical SSD into one machine.

However, the **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2)** volume types introduce a feature called **Multi-Attach**.  
It lets you connect the same volume to **up to 16 EC2 instances** *simultaneously* within the **same Availability Zone**.

💡 **Why this exists:**  
Some enterprise or clustered applications (for example, Oracle RAC or shared file systems) need multiple servers to read and write to the same shared disk.  
Multi-Attach gives them a common block-level layer while keeping latency extremely low.

⚙️ **How it behaves**
- Every attached EC2 gets a unique device name (e.g., `/dev/sdf`, `/dev/sdg` …).  
- All instances see the **same data blocks** in real time.  
- There’s **no built-in locking** — your application must manage concurrent writes safely (through a clustered file system or DB engine).  
- If ordinary servers try to write at the same time without coordination, data corruption can occur.

🧭 **Architect’s Note:**  
Use Multi-Attach only when your workload is explicitly designed for shared block access.  
For general cases, treat EBS as a **one-to-one disk** between an instance and its volume — simpler, faster, safer.

<summary><strong>3. EBS Volume Types</strong></summary>

| Volume Type | Medium | Description | Best For |
|--------------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **gp3** | SSD | General-purpose SSD with configurable IOPS (up to 16,000) and throughput (up to 1,000 MB/s). | Most workloads – OS, applications, boot volumes |
| **io2/io1** | SSD | Provisioned IOPS SSD with consistent latency and Multi-Attach support. | High-performance databases |
| **st1** | HDD | Throughput-optimized HDD for large sequential workloads. | Big data, logs, streaming workloads |
| **sc1** | HDD | Cold HDD with lowest cost and lowest performance. | Archival and infrequently accessed data |

💡 **Tip:**  
Use **gp3** by default unless you have a clear reason to optimize for either IOPS (io2/io1) or cost (st1/sc1).

📘 **Durability:**  
EBS volumes provide **99.999% availability** within an AZ due to internal replication.

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Snapshots & Backup Mechanism</strong></summary>

A **snapshot** is a **point-in-time backup** of an EBS volume stored in Amazon S3.  
Although stored in S3, snapshots are managed transparently by EBS.

```

EBS Volume → Snapshot → New Volume

```

- **First snapshot** = full copy  
- **Subsequent snapshots** = incremental (only changed blocks)
- Snapshots can be **used to create new volumes**, **copied across regions**, or **automated via Lifecycle Manager**.

💡 **Analogy:**  
It’s like taking a **photo of your disk’s current state**.  
If anything breaks later, you can rebuild an exact copy using that snapshot.

<details>
<summary><strong>5. Cross-AZ and Cross-Region Copy</strong></summary>

You can use snapshots to **clone volumes** across Availability Zones or Regions.

### Cross-AZ (within same region)
1. Create a snapshot of the source volume (e.g., `us-east-1a`).
2. Use that snapshot to create a new volume in another AZ (e.g., `us-east-1b`).
3. Attach it to an EC2 instance there.

### Cross-Region
1. Copy the snapshot to another region.
2. Create a volume from that copy.
3. Attach to EC2 in the destination region.

💡 **Analogy:**  
It’s like **replicating your disk** to a different branch office — same setup, new location.

<summary><strong>6. EBS Encryption</strong></summary>

EBS provides **encryption at rest and in transit** using **AWS KMS** (Key Management Service).  
You can use **AWS-managed keys (aws/ebs)** or **customer-managed CMKs**.

**Key points:**
- Encrypted data stays encrypted during I/O operations.
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are also encrypted.
- New volumes created from encrypted snapshots remain encrypted.
- Enable **EBS encryption by default** in your account for consistency.

📘 **Command:**
```bash
aws ec2 enable-ebs-encryption-by-default
````

📸 **Reference:** [EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html)

<details>
<summary><strong>7. Modifying Volumes (Resize, Migrate, Tune)</strong></summary>

You can dynamically **resize** or **change** EBS volume attributes without detaching it.

**Options you can modify:**

* Size (GB)
* IOPS
* Throughput (for gp3)

**After resizing:**

* Extend partition and filesystem inside the OS (`growpart`, `xfs_growfs`).

**Migration approach:**

* Create snapshot → New volume (different type or region) → Attach → Sync data.

📘 **Example command:**

```bash
aws ec2 modify-volume --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef --size 200 --iops 8000 --throughput 600
```

<summary><strong>8. Performance Essentials (IOPS & Throughput)</strong></summary>

**IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)** → speed for small random reads/writes.
**Throughput (MB/s)** → speed for large sequential data transfers.

| Metric     | gp3 (max)  | io2 (max)             | st1/sc1              |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| IOPS       | 16,000     | 256,000 (provisioned) | Low                  |
| Throughput | 1,000 MB/s | 4,000 MB/s            | High sequential only |
| Latency    | ~5 ms      | <1 ms                 | High (HDD latency)   |

💡 **Tip:**
Monitor performance using **CloudWatch metrics** like `VolumeReadOps`, `VolumeWriteOps`, `VolumeThroughputPercentage`, etc.

<summary><strong>9. Best Practices & Cost Optimization</strong></summary>

✅ Use **gp3** for most workloads (better performance per $).
✅ Set **volume and snapshot tags** for cost tracking.
✅ Enable **EBS Lifecycle Manager** to automatically delete old snapshots.
✅ For large-scale systems, **align IOPS with EC2 bandwidth** to avoid bottlenecks.
✅ Use **RAID 0** (striping) for high I/O and **RAID 1** (mirroring) for durability if needed.
✅ Always **unmount before detaching** volumes to avoid data corruption.
