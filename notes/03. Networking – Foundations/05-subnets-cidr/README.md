# Network Segmentation (Subnets & CIDR)

## What this file is about

This file teaches **how to divide networks into smaller segments** and **how to read CIDR notation**. If you understand this, you'll be able to calculate how many IPs are available in any block and design networks that don't conflict. This is the universal foundation — how CIDR applies specifically to AWS VPCs is covered in the AWS notes.

## The Core Problem

### The Question

**Scenario:** You're setting up a network for a company.

**Requirements:**
- Web servers (need 50 IPs)
- Application servers (need 100 IPs)
- Databases (need 10 IPs)
- Each group should be isolated for security

**Questions:**
1. How do you divide the network?
2. How many IPs do you need total?
3. How do you prevent IP conflicts?
4. How do you ensure room for growth?

**This is what subnetting solves.**

---

### Why You Can't Just Use One Big Network

**Without subnetting (all devices in 192.168.1.0/24):**

```
Problems:
❌ Can't isolate web servers from databases (security risk)
❌ Can't apply different firewall rules to different groups
❌ Broadcast storms (everyone sees everyone's traffic)
❌ Difficult to manage (254 devices in one flat network)
❌ No logical organization
```

**With subnetting (divided logically):**

```
Benefits:
✅ Web servers:  10.0.1.0/24 (isolated)
✅ App servers:  10.0.2.0/24 (isolated)
✅ Databases:    10.0.3.0/24 (isolated)
✅ Different firewall rules per subnet
✅ Better performance (smaller broadcast domains)
✅ Organized and manageable
```

---

## Why Subnets Exist

### The Historical Context

**You now understand routers** (from File 04).

**Key insight from that file:**
- Routers separate networks
- Each router interface is on a different network
- Devices on different networks need a router to communicate

**Subnets exist BECAUSE routers exist.**

---

### Subnets Create Network Boundaries

**One large network (no subnetting):**

```
Company network: 10.0.0.0/16 (65,534 hosts)
All departments share one network

Problems:
- No isolation
- Single broadcast domain (inefficient)
- Can't apply per-department security rules
```

**Multiple subnets (segmented):**

```
Company network: 10.0.0.0/16

Subnet 1 (Marketing):    10.0.1.0/24  (254 hosts)
Subnet 2 (Engineering):  10.0.2.0/24  (254 hosts)
Subnet 3 (Finance):      10.0.3.0/24  (254 hosts)
Subnet 4 (HR):           10.0.4.0/24  (254 hosts)

Benefits:
- Departments isolated
- Different firewall rules per department
- Better performance
- Easier troubleshooting
```

---

### The Four Reasons Subnets Exist

```
1. Security / Isolation
   Separate sensitive systems from others

2. Organization
   Logical grouping of devices

3. Performance
   Smaller broadcast domains

4. Address Management
   Efficient use of IP space
```

---

## Subnet Masks (The Divider)

### What Is a Subnet Mask?

**Definition:**  
A subnet mask defines which part of an IP address is the network portion and which part is the host portion.

**Purpose:**  
Tells your device: "These IPs are local (same network), everything else is remote (need router)."

---

### How Subnet Masks Work

**Example IP and mask:**

```
IP Address:   192.168.1.45
Subnet Mask:  255.255.255.0
```

**What this means:**

```
IP Address:     192  .  168  .  1    .  45
Subnet Mask:    255  .  255  .  255  .  0
                │       │       │       │
                Network Network Network Host
                portion portion portion portion
```

**Translation:**

```
Network portion: 192.168.1  (first 3 octets)
  This defines the network
  All devices on this network have 192.168.1.X

Host portion: 45  (last octet)
  This identifies the specific device
  Can be 0-255 (actually 1-254 usable)
```

---

### Binary View (How It Really Works)

**IP Address: 192.168.1.45**

```
Decimal:  192      .  168      .  1        .  45
Binary:   11000000 .  10101000 .  00000001 .  00101101
```

**Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0**

```
Decimal:  255      .  255      .  255      .  0
Binary:   11111111 .  11111111 .  11111111 .  00000000
          │                                   │
          Network bits (1s)                   Host bits (0s)
```

**The rule:**

```
Where mask has 1 → Network portion (fixed for this network)
Where mask has 0 → Host portion (varies per device)
```

---

### Common Subnet Masks

| Subnet Mask | Binary | Network Bits | Host Bits | Total Hosts |
|-------------|--------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 255.0.0.0 | 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000 | 8 | 24 | 16,777,214 |
| 255.255.0.0 | 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000 | 16 | 16 | 65,534 |
| 255.255.255.0 | 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | 24 | 8 | 254 |
| 255.255.255.128 | 11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000 | 25 | 7 | 126 |
| 255.255.255.192 | 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 | 26 | 6 | 62 |

---

### How Devices Use Subnet Masks

**Your laptop's configuration:**

```
IP:   192.168.1.45
Mask: 255.255.255.0
```

**You want to reach 192.168.1.67:**

```
Your network:   192.168.1.0
Target network: 192.168.1.0
Match → SAME NETWORK → Send direct
```

**You want to reach 192.168.2.50:**

```
Your network:   192.168.1.0
Target network: 192.168.2.0
No match → DIFFERENT NETWORK → Send to gateway
```

---

## CIDR Notation (The Shorthand)

### What Is CIDR?

**CIDR = Classless Inter-Domain Routing**

**Purpose:**  
A shorter way to write IP address + subnet mask together.

**Instead of:**

```
Network:      192.168.1.0
Subnet Mask:  255.255.255.0
```

**Write:**

```
192.168.1.0/24
```

---

### What the /Number Means

**The number after the slash = how many network bits**

```
192.168.1.0/24
            └─ 24 bits for network
               32 - 24 = 8 bits for hosts
```

**Conversion:**

```
/24 → 24 network bits → Subnet mask 255.255.255.0

Why 255.255.255.0?
  First 24 bits are 1s: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
  In decimal: 255.255.255.0
```

---

### Common CIDR to Subnet Mask Conversions

| CIDR | Subnet Mask | Network Bits | Host Bits |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| /8 | 255.0.0.0 | 8 | 24 |
| /16 | 255.255.0.0 | 16 | 16 |
| /24 | 255.255.255.0 | 24 | 8 |
| /25 | 255.255.255.128 | 25 | 7 |
| /26 | 255.255.255.192 | 26 | 6 |
| /27 | 255.255.255.224 | 27 | 5 |
| /28 | 255.255.255.240 | 28 | 4 |
| /30 | 255.255.255.252 | 30 | 2 |
| /32 | 255.255.255.255 | 32 | 0 |

---

### CIDR Block Examples

**Example 1: 10.0.0.0/16**

```
Range:  10.0.0.0 - 10.0.255.255
Total:  2^16 = 65,536 IPs
Usable: 65,534
```

**Example 2: 192.168.1.0/24**

```
Range:  192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255
Total:  2^8 = 256 IPs
Usable: 254
```

**Example 3: 172.16.0.0/12**

```
Range:  172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
Total:  2^20 = 1,048,576 IPs
Usable: 1,048,574
```

---

### Why CIDR Is Better Than Old Classes

**Old system (before 1993):**

```
Class A: /8  (16 million IPs per network)
Class B: /16 (65,536 IPs per network)
Class C: /24 (256 IPs per network)

Problem:
  Company needs 500 IPs
  Class C too small (256)
  Class B too big (65,536) — Waste!
```

**CIDR system (modern):**

```
Need 500 IPs? Use /23 (512 IPs)
Need 1000 IPs? Use /22 (1024 IPs)

Flexible! Any size you need.
```

---

## Calculating Available IPs

### The Formula

**Given CIDR notation:**

```
Total IPs = 2^(32 - CIDR)

Usable IPs = Total - 2
  -1 for network address (first IP)
  -1 for broadcast address (last IP)
```

---

### Step-by-Step Calculation

**Example: 192.168.1.0/26**

```
Step 1: Identify host bits
  CIDR: /26
  Host bits: 32 - 26 = 6 bits

Step 2: Calculate total IPs
  Total: 2^6 = 64 IPs

Step 3: Calculate usable IPs
  Usable: 64 - 2 = 62 IPs

Step 4: Determine range
  Network address:   192.168.1.0   (reserved)
  First usable:      192.168.1.1
  Last usable:       192.168.1.62
  Broadcast address: 192.168.1.63  (reserved)
```

---

### Quick Reference Table

| CIDR | Host Bits | Total IPs | Usable IPs | Use Case |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| /32 | 0 | 1 | 1 | Single host (security group rule) |
| /30 | 2 | 4 | 2 | Point-to-point links |
| /29 | 3 | 8 | 6 | Very small subnet |
| /28 | 4 | 16 | 14 | Small subnet |
| /27 | 5 | 32 | 30 | Small subnet |
| /26 | 6 | 64 | 62 | Medium subnet |
| /25 | 7 | 128 | 126 | Medium subnet |
| /24 | 8 | 256 | 254 | Standard subnet |
| /23 | 9 | 512 | 510 | Medium-large subnet |
| /22 | 10 | 1,024 | 1,022 | Large subnet |
| /20 | 12 | 4,096 | 4,094 | Very large subnet |
| /16 | 16 | 65,536 | 65,534 | Large network |
| /8 | 24 | 16,777,216 | 16,777,214 | Massive network |

---

### Reserved Addresses

**In every subnet, two addresses are reserved:**

```
Example: 192.168.1.0/24

Network address:   192.168.1.0    (identifies the subnet)
Broadcast address: 192.168.1.255  (send to all hosts)

Usable range:      192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254
```

---

## Common CIDR Blocks (Memorize These)

### The Essential Four

```
/32 = 1 IP (single host)
/24 = 256 IPs (254 usable) — standard subnet
/16 = 65,536 IPs — large network
/8  = 16.7 million IPs — entire private range
```

---

### Mental Shortcuts

**Powers of 2:**

```
/32 = 2^0  = 1
/28 = 2^4  = 16
/26 = 2^6  = 64
/24 = 2^8  = 256      ← Memorize
/22 = 2^10 = 1,024
/20 = 2^12 = 4,096
/16 = 2^16 = 65,536   ← Memorize
/8  = 2^24 = 16,777,216
```

---

## Subnet Planning Rules

### Rule 1: Avoid Overlap

**❌ BAD (subnets overlap):**

```
Subnet A: 10.0.1.0/24  (10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255)
Subnet B: 10.0.1.128/25 (10.0.1.128 - 10.0.1.255)
                          ↑
                    Overlap! Conflict!
```

**✅ GOOD (no overlap):**

```
Subnet A: 10.0.1.0/24   (10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255)
Subnet B: 10.0.2.0/24   (10.0.2.0 - 10.0.2.255)
```

---

### Rule 2: Plan for Growth

```
Need 50 IPs → Use /24 (254 usable)
  Room for growth: 254 - 50 = 204 IPs available

Rule of thumb: Allocate 2-3x what you need today.
```

---

### Rule 3: Use Consistent Sizing

**✅ Consistent (easy to manage):**

```
Web subnet:  10.0.1.0/24
App subnet:  10.0.2.0/24
DB subnet:   10.0.3.0/24

Same size, predictable, simple
```

---

### Rule 4: Smaller CIDR = Bigger Network

```
/24 = 256 IPs    (bigger subnet)
/26 = 64 IPs     (smaller subnet)
/28 = 16 IPs     (even smaller)

Lower number = MORE IPs
Higher number = FEWER IPs
```

---

### Rule 5: Leave Room Between Subnets

```
VPC: 10.0.0.0/16

Current subnets:
  Web:  10.0.1.0/24
  App:  10.0.2.0/24
  DB:   10.0.3.0/24

Reserved for future:
  10.0.4.0/24 - 10.0.255.0/24 (available)
```

---

## Subnetting Practice

### Exercise 1: Calculate Usable IPs

**Given: 192.168.10.0/27**

```
Step 1: Find host bits
  Host bits = 32 - 27 = 5 bits

Step 2: Calculate total IPs
  Total = 2^5 = 32 IPs

Step 3: Calculate usable
  Usable = 32 - 2 = 30 IPs

Step 4: Determine range
  Network:   192.168.10.0
  First:     192.168.10.1
  Last:      192.168.10.30
  Broadcast: 192.168.10.31
```

---

### Exercise 2: Choose Right CIDR

**Requirement: Need subnet for 100 hosts**

```
Options:
  /25 = 128 IPs (126 usable) ✓ Sufficient
  /26 = 64 IPs (62 usable)   ✗ Too small
  /24 = 256 IPs (254 usable) ✓ Room for growth

Best choice: /24 (room for growth)
```

---

### Exercise 3: Identify Conflicts

**Which subnets overlap?**

```
A: 10.0.1.0/24   (10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255)
B: 10.0.2.0/24   (10.0.2.0 - 10.0.2.255)
C: 10.0.1.128/25 (10.0.1.128 - 10.0.1.255)

Answer: A and C overlap
  A covers 10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255
  C covers 10.0.1.128 - 10.0.1.255
  Conflict in 10.0.1.128 - 10.0.1.255 range
```

## Final Compression

### Subnet Mask Basics

```
Subnet mask = Defines network boundary

255.255.255.0 means:
  First 3 octets = network (192.168.1)
  Last octet = hosts (0-255)
```

---

### CIDR Notation

```
Format: IP/Number

192.168.1.0/24
            └─ 24 network bits
               8 host bits remain

Formula:
  Total IPs = 2^(32 - CIDR)
  Usable = Total - 2
```

---

### The Essential CIDRs (Memorize)

```
/32 = 1 IP       (single host)
/24 = 256 IPs    (standard subnet)
/16 = 65,536 IPs (large network)
/8  = 16.7M IPs  (entire private range)
```

---

### Subnet Planning Rules

```
1. No overlap (check ranges)
2. Plan for growth (use 2-3x needed)
3. Consistent sizing (all /24 is easier)
4. Smaller CIDR = bigger network (/16 > /24)
5. Leave gaps for future expansion
```

---

### Mental Model

```
Subnetting = Dividing a network into smaller pieces

Why?
  Security (isolate systems)
  Organization (logical groups)
  Performance (smaller domains)

How?
  Subnet mask defines boundary
  CIDR notation is shorthand
```

---

### What You Can Do Now

✅ Calculate IPs from CIDR (/24 = 256 IPs)  
✅ Avoid subnet overlap conflicts  
✅ Choose appropriate subnet sizes  
✅ Understand subnet masks  
✅ Plan for growth and future expansion
