<summary><strong>1. Reading Project History – Following Every Change</strong></summary>

Every Git repository maintains a **complete timeline of your project** — every edit, commit, and merge is recorded permanently.  
Exploring history is how developers audit progress, find bugs, and understand evolution.

---

### Key Commands for Viewing History
| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `git log` | Show full commit history with author, date, and message. |
| `git log --oneline` | Condensed summary (short hash + message). |
| `git show <commit>` | Display detailed info and file changes for a specific commit. |
| `git diff` | Compare unstaged changes with last commit. |
| `git diff --staged` | Compare staged changes with last commit. |
| `git log --graph` | ASCII diagram of commit and merge history. |

---

### Viewing the Commit Timeline
```bash
git log
````

Output:

```
commit 09f4acd3f8836b7f6fc44ad9e012f82faf861803 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Akhil Teja Doosari <doosariakhilteja@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 12 10:30:00 2025 -0500

    Add responsive navbar
```

* Use **↑/↓** to scroll.
* Type `/keyword` to search.
* Press `q` to quit the log view.

---

### Summary View (Compact Log)

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Example:

```
a91b23c Add responsive navbar  
b78d23d Fix login bug  
c11aa8d Initial commit
```

Each line begins with a **short commit hash** — the fingerprint of that snapshot.
Git uses these hashes for tagging, branching, and rollbacks.

---

### Inspect a Specific Commit

```bash
git show <commit-hash>
```

Example:

```bash
git show a91b23c
```

Shows:

* Author, timestamp, and message
* Diff of files changed

---

### Compare File Versions

```bash
git diff              # unstaged changes
git diff --staged     # staged but uncommitted changes
```

Example:

```bash
diff --git a/index.html b/index.html
--- a/index.html
+++ b/index.html
@@ -5,7 +5,7 @@
-<h1>Old Title</h1>
+<h1>New Title</h1>
```

To compare two commits directly:

```bash
git diff 1a2b3c4 9f8e7d6
```

---

### Graphing History

```bash
git log --graph --oneline
```

Output:

```
* 7d33e45 Merge branch 'feature/auth'
|\
| * b24aa33 Add password validation
| * c28ef12 Update login page
* | a7bc9d2 Improve navbar layout
|/
```

This visualizes how branches diverge and converge — your project’s **time map**.

<summary><strong>2. Branching Fundamentals – Parallel Timelines in Git</strong></summary>

In Git, a **branch** is a lightweight pointer to a series of commits — a *parallel universe* where you can experiment freely.

<img src="images/branch-concept.png" alt="Branch Concept" width="850" height="300" />

---

### Why Branches Exist

* Develop new features safely.
* Fix bugs without touching main code.
* Experiment and discard easily.
* Work in teams without overwriting each other.

Without branching, you’d copy folders (`v1`, `v2`, `v3`) — messy and error-prone.
With Git, branches keep experiments organized within the same repository.

---

### The HEAD Pointer

`HEAD` tells Git *where you currently are* — the latest commit in your active branch.
Switching branches moves `HEAD` to another line of history.

* Default branch: **main** (formerly **master**).
* Nothing magical about the name — it’s just convention.

---

### Key Branch Commands

| Command                 | Purpose                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `git branch`            | List all branches.             |
| `git branch <name>`     | Create a new branch.           |
| `git switch <name>`     | Switch to an existing branch.  |
| `git switch -c <name>`  | Create and switch in one step. |
| `git branch -m old new` | Rename a branch.               |
| `git branch -d <name>`  | Delete a branch (merged).      |
| `git branch -D <name>`  | Force delete (unmerged).       |

<summary><strong>3. Working with Branches – Create, Switch & Merge</strong></summary>

Let’s walk through a real scenario:

---

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git branch feature/homepage
git switch feature/homepage
```

You’re now in a sandbox — safe to modify code.

Make changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add hero banner"
```

---

### 2. Return to Main

```bash
git switch main
```

You’ll see only main’s files — branch work stays isolated.

---

### 3. Merge Feature Back to Main

```bash
git merge feature/homepage
```

If main hasn’t changed since you branched, Git performs a **fast-forward merge**:

```
main → feature/homepage → merged cleanly
```

History remains linear and clean.

</p>

---

### 4. Divergent Branches → 3-Way Merge

If both main and your branch have commits since branching:

```bash
git switch main
git merge feature/homepage
```

Git performs a **3-way merge**:

1. Finds common ancestor
2. Compares changes in both tips
3. Creates a new **merge commit**

</p>

---

### 5. Delete or Keep Branch

Once merged:

```bash
git branch -d feature/homepage
```

If unmerged but you want to remove:

```bash
git branch -D feature/homepage
```

Branches are lightweight — create, merge, and delete freely.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Merging Types & Conflict Resolution</strong></summary>

Even with Git’s precision, **conflicts** happen when two branches modify the same lines.

Example conflict marker in file:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
<h1>Homepage</h1>
=======
<h1>New Homepage</h1>
>>>>>>> feature/homepage
```

You decide which version to keep, edit, then:

```bash
git add <file>
git commit
```

Visual tools can help:

* **VS Code Merge Editor** – inline resolution
* **GitHub web merge** – compare visually
* **CLI tools** – use `git mergetool`

</p>

---

### Best Practices

* Keep branches small and focused.
* Merge frequently to reduce conflict scope.
* Communicate with teammates about shared files.
* Avoid long-lived branches when possible.

<details>
<summary><strong>5. Managing History – Keeping Your Timeline Clean</strong></summary>

When you merge, Git may create a **merge commit** — a checkpoint combining two lines of development.
These commits preserve collaboration context.

<img src="images/merge-history.png" alt="Merge History" width="750" height="250" />

---

### Merge Commits Explained

* A **fast-forward** merge moves the branch pointer ahead — no new commit.
* A **3-way** merge creates a distinct commit joining histories.
* Merge commits help visualize *when* branches were integrated.

To keep your history readable:

* Write clear, meaningful messages for merges.
* Rebase feature branches (optional advanced cleanup).
* Delete old branches once merged.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>6. Mentor Insight</strong></summary>

History shows *what happened*; branching lets you *shape what happens next.*
You now understand how to trace, fork, and merge timelines — the foundation of collaborative version control.

Next, we’ll move beyond local experimentation and explore **team contribution flows**:
**Forks, clones, and pull requests** — how real collaboration happens in the open-source world.
