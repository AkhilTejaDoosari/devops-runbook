<summary><strong>1. Git Stash – Pausing Unfinished Work</strong></summary>

### Why Git Stash Exists  
Sometimes you need to switch tasks, fix a bug, or test something quickly, but your current work isn’t ready to commit.  
**Git stash** acts like a temporary *shelf* for unfinished changes — letting you save progress, return to a clean state, and restore your work later.

---

### Key Commands for Stashing  
| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `git stash` | Save tracked changes (staged + unstaged). |
| `git stash -u` or `--include-untracked` | Include new/untracked files. |
| `git stash push -m "message"` | Stash with a custom message. |
| `git stash list` | Show all saved stashes. |
| `git stash show [-p]` | Show summary (`-p` = full diff). |
| `git stash apply [stash@{n}]` | Re-apply stash (keeps it). |
| `git stash pop [stash@{n}]` | Apply + delete stash. |
| `git stash drop stash@{n}` | Delete a specific stash. |
| `git stash clear` | Delete all stashes (irreversible). |
| `git stash branch <branch>` | Create a new branch from a stash. |

---

### How Stashing Works  
Each stash you create is added to a **stack**:  
```

stash@{0}   ← newest
stash@{1}
stash@{2}   ← oldest

````
The top of the stack (`stash@{0}`) is the most recent.  
You can apply, pop, or drop stashes selectively.

---

### Example: Save and Restore Work  
```bash
git stash push -m "WIP: homepage redesign"
# ... switch branches, fix a bug ...
git stash apply stash@{0}    # reapply changes
git stash pop stash@{0}      # apply + remove
````

---

### Including Untracked Files

By default, untracked (new) files are ignored.
To stash them too:

```bash
git stash -u
```

---

### Viewing and Inspecting Stashes

List your saved stashes:

```bash
git stash list
```

Show what changed in the latest stash:

```bash
git stash show
```

See exact line-by-line changes:

```bash
git stash show -p
```

---

### Create a Branch from a Stash

Sometimes your stashed work deserves its own branch:

```bash
git stash branch new-feature stash@{0}
```

This creates a new branch, applies the stash, and removes it once done.

---

### Best Practices for Stashing

* Use clear messages:
  `git stash push -m "WIP: user-auth feature"`
* Don’t treat stashes as long-term storage — commit soon after testing.
* Review and clean old stashes regularly (`git stash list` + `git stash drop`).
* Remember: stashes are **local only** and may expire after ~90 days.

---

### Troubleshooting

| Problem                    | Likely Cause / Fix                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Lost changes               | Run `git stash list` → `git stash apply`.       |
| Conflicts on apply         | Resolve manually (like merge conflicts).        |
| Untracked files missing    | Use `git stash -u` next time.                   |
| Accidentally cleared stash | `git stash clear` is permanent — can’t recover. |

<summary><strong>2. Git Tags – Marking Versions and Releases</strong></summary>

### Why Git Tags Exist

Commits tell a project’s full story, but tags mark the **key chapters** — the release versions, milestones, and hotfix points that teams rely on.
They make it easy to find, share, and deploy specific builds.

---

### Key Commands for Tagging

| Command                                  | Description                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `git tag <tagname>`                      | Create a lightweight tag.                 |
| `git tag -a <tagname> -m "message"`      | Create an annotated tag (recommended).    |
| `git tag <tagname> <commit-hash>`        | Tag an older commit.                      |
| `git tag`                                | List all tags.                            |
| `git show <tagname>`                     | Show tag + commit details.                |
| `git push origin <tagname>`              | Push one tag to remote.                   |
| `git push --tags`                        | Push all tags to remote.                  |
| `git tag -d <tagname>`                   | Delete local tag.                         |
| `git push origin --delete tag <tagname>` | Delete remote tag.                        |
| `git tag -f <tagname> <new-hash>`        | Move an existing tag.                     |
| `git push --force origin <tagname>`      | Overwrite tag on remote (use cautiously). |

---

### Lightweight vs Annotated Tags

| Type            | Contains              | Best For                       |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Lightweight** | Commit pointer only   | Quick bookmarks or local refs  |
| **Annotated**   | Author, date, message | Releases and shared milestones |

Example:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 release"
```

---

### Tag a Specific Commit

```bash
git tag v1.1 1a2b3c4d
```

Useful when tagging older commits by their hash.

---

### List and Inspect Tags

```bash
git tag             # list all
git show v1.0       # view commit + metadata
```

---

### Pushing Tags to Remote

Tags are not pushed automatically — you must send them explicitly.

```bash
git push origin v1.0    # push one
git push --tags         # push all
```

If you push commits without tags, others won’t see them until you do this step.

---

### Managing and Updating Tags

```bash
git tag -d v1.0                           # delete locally
git push origin --delete tag v1.0         # delete remotely
git tag -f v1.1 <new-commit>              # move tag
git push --force origin v1.1              # overwrite remote
```

---

### When to Use Tags

* **Releases:** Mark stable versions (`v1.0`, `v2.0`).
* **Milestones:** Feature completions or sprint goals.
* **Deployments:** CI/CD tools reference tags for build selection.
* **Hotfixes:** Return to old versions safely.

---

### Best Practices for Tagging

* Prefer annotated tags (`-a -m`) for any shared or public history.
* Tag only *stable* commits after tests pass.
* Follow semantic versioning (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.2`, etc.).
* Avoid `--force` unless correcting an unavoidable mistake.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem               | Solution                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tag already exists    | `git tag -d <tag>` → recreate.                                     |
| Wrong tag pushed      | Delete local + remote, then push correct one.                      |
| Tag missing on remote | Run `git push origin <tag>`.                                       |
| Need to move a tag    | `git tag -f <tag> <new-commit>` + force push (communicate change). |

Stash and Tag represent two sides of discipline in version control:

* **Stash** protects your unfinished ideas — a temporary workspace to stay flexible.
* **Tag** preserves your finished milestones — a permanent signpost of progress.

Together, they give rhythm to your workflow:
pause confidently, resume smoothly, and celebrate stability with precision.

Next, we’ll explore how Git records and visualizes that history — through **branches and commit navigation**.
